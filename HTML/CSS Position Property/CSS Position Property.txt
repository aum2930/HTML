 psoition static: 
position relative: it means younow your container is not static it is movable now.
z-index: this thing means that you can let ovr lap the upper box on the main box. to set z index position is mandatory.kisi ki bhi z-index ki value jyada hogi it will be upper form everyone and the one who hs lesser z-index it will be very down then everyone.
position absolute: ye nearest position ansister ke relative lage ga.
for eg: papa(parent)if position is not given on that it will go to > body(dada) it will ask taht dada are you alloted the posotion if yes then it will set relative accordingly and if not then it will ask to > doctype html(per dada ) and get set accordingly.
position fixed: it will stay fixed even if i scroll.( scruew thi fit kari didhu)
position sticky: always stays on top when scroll down and it got stick when you scroll and when you dont scroll it stays static. 
transfrom, perspective and filter when we use the box will take relative as the parent not html because it acts like a position element.
